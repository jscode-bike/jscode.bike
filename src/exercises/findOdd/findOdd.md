# Find Odd Integer

Write a function `findOdd` that accepts an array of positive integers which all appear exactly 2 times, except one of those integers, which is not repeated and only appears one time. Your function should return the integer which only appears in the array once.

```javascript
// Examples:
findOdd([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]); // should return 3
findOdd([5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // 1
findOdd([10, 15, 100, 10, 20, 15, 100]); // 20
```
