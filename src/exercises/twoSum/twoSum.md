# Two Sum

Given an array `nums`, return indices of the two numbers that add up the a given target number. Assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you can't use the same element twice.

## Example

```javascript
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;

twoSum(nums, target); // [0, 1]
```
