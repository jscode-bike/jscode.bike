# Two Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return indices of the two numbers that add up to the given `target` number. Assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you can't use the same element twice.

```javascript
// Examples:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;

twoSum(nums, target); // [0, 1]

const nums2 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11];
const target2 = 18;

twoSum(nums2, target2); // [3, 5]

const nums3 = [10, 15, 25, 100, 40, 65];
const target3 = 55;

twoSum(nums3, target3); // [1, 4]
```
